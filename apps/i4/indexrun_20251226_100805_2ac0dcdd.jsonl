Globally 0.6–1.3% of the general popula - tion is affected by VWD; in a study from US hemophilia treat - ment centers (HTCs) from 2012 through 2019, the age-adjusted prevalence of VWD was 8.6 per 100,000 individuals [2,3].", "metadata": {"study_type": "paper", "source_type": "paper", "source": "Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in people with von Willebrand disease treated prophylactically with recombinant von Willebrand factor in th.pdf", "doc_id": "paper::Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in people with von Willebrand disease treated prophylactically with recombinant von Willebrand factor in th.pdf::page::1::54", "snapshot_id": "snapshot_20251226_100649_72fa1716", "provenance": "{\"page\": 1, \"source_file\": \"Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in people with von Willebrand disease treated prophylactically with recombinant von Willebrand factor in th.pdf\"}", "split_unit": "heading", "split_idx": 0, "chunk_idx": 1153}}

VWD is caused by qualitative and quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a plasma protein mediating pri- mary and secondary hemostasis [4]. There are three major types of VWD: Type 1 VWD is an incomplete quantitative deficiency of VWF; Type 2 VWD is characterized by various qualitative defects in VWF; and Type 3 VWD is an almost complete quantitative deficiency of VWF [5,6].", "metadata": {"study_type": "paper", "source_type": "paper", "source": "Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in people with von Willebrand disease treated prophylactically with recombinant von Willebrand factor in th.pdf", "doc_id": "paper::Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in people with von Willebrand disease treated prophylactically with recombinant von Willebrand factor in th.pdf::page::1::54", "snapshot_id": "snapshot_20251226_100649_72fa1716", "provenance": "{\"page\": 1, \"source_file\": \"Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in people with von Willebrand disease treated prophylactically with recombinant von Willebrand factor in th.pdf\"}", "split_unit": "heading", "split_idx": 0, "chunk_idx": 1154}}
